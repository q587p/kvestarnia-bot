# Changelog

All notable project changes are documented here.

This project follows a simple pre-1.0 versioning policy:
- `0.0.x` for foundation and local playability slices.
- `0.x.0` for larger MVP milestones.
- Breaking changes may still happen before `1.0.0`, but they should be called out explicitly.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- Initial TypeScript + Node.js Telegram bot foundation using grammY, Prisma, Zod, Vitest, and npm scripts.
- Local SQLite development database setup with Prisma migrations and `DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db`.
- `/start` onboarding with race and class selection through versioned Telegram callback data.
- Persistent `User` and `Character` models with starter stats, race/class content IDs, HP, mana, XP, and gold.
- `/hero`, `/profile`, `/me`, `/help`, and dev-only `/dev_reset_me` commands for local playthrough testing.
- Main menu callbacks for hero, help, and tavern placeholder actions.
- Safe Telegram message editing that ignores repeated-button `message is not modified` responses.
- Unit tests for content validation, callback parsing, starter stats, onboarding idempotency, presenters, dev reset behavior, config parsing, and the domain/Telegram boundary.
- GitHub Actions CI for linting, typechecking, tests, Prisma validation, and build.

### Changed
- Local development no longer requires Docker, pnpm, or a running PostgreSQL server.
- Project workflow is npm-only.
- Documentation now points local maintainers toward SQLite-backed setup and `npm run check` for PR verification.

### Removed
- Docker Compose local development dependency.
- Stale pnpm workflow references.

### Not Included Yet
- Combat, adventure loop, loot, inventory, raids, guilds, PvP, jobs, payments, and Mini App UI.
